# Welcome!
This is a program dedicated to simplifying the management of high-usage community / public 3D printers. See our feature-set below:

## Keep prints on schedule, always.
OPQ (Open Print Queue) works on a "ticketing" system, where tickets for prints are created and completed chronologically. This means that any manager doesn't have the headache of trying to distribute and send multiple prints. No more late prints, missing files, or wrong slicing.

## Designed with 3D Printing in mind.
